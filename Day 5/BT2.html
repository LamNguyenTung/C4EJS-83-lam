    <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life, Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anthologist-Novel-Nicholson-Baker/dp/1416572449/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1RXY1Y4UPOUO6&dchild=1&keywords=the+anthologist&qid=1591242266&sprefix=the+anthologist%2Caps%2C348&sr=8-1" target="_blank">"The Anthologist"</a>,crawls in the margins of Oliver's,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Selected-Poems-Mary-Oliver/dp/0807068772/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1UDJZAOI4Q7F9&dchild=1&keywords=new+and+selected+poems%2C+volume+one&qid=1591242512&sprefix=new+and+se%2Caps%2C339&sr=8-1" target="_blank">"New and Selected Poems,Volume One"</a> A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because ha has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple, And yet each has something."</p>

        I don't know exactly what a prayer is. <br>
        I do know to pay attention, how to fall down <br>
        into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass, <br>
        how to the idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, <br>
        which is what I have been doing all day.
